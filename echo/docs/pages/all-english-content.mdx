# Welcome!  
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optimally use the dashboard and chat function. We'll follow a step-by-step approach that helps you efficiently navigate through large amounts of conversation data.

## Step 1: Start with the Library  
Before diving into chat, it's crucial to get a good overview:  

1. Open the Library function  
2. Formulate a clear main question (views)  
3. Let the system identify the key themes  
4. Explore the different clusters that emerge

**Tip:** Think of the Library as your "map" of all available information. It helps you understand where to find specific information.

## Step 2: Explore the Themes  
In the Library, you can:  

- Click on interesting clusters  
- Read brief summaries  
- View relevant quotes  
- Click on the quotes to go to full transcripts

**Why this works:** You quickly gain insight into the main themes without getting lost in details.

## Step 3: Targeted Chat Questions  
Now that you know what information is available:  

- Select relevant conversations (max. ~10 hours of material)  
- Ask specific questions about the themes you've identified  
- Use the chat for in-depth analysis

**Important:** The chat has limited capacity. Therefore, be selective about which conversations you want to analyse.


## Working with Large Datasets  
When dealing with extensive conversation data:  

1. Use the Library to identify key themes  
2. Select the most relevant conversations for chat analysis  
3. Break down your research into manageable segments  
4. Use exports to compile comprehensive reports

## Technical Notes  
- Chat buffer: approximately 10% per hour of conversation  
- Maximum recommended conversations in chat: ~10 hours total  
- Libraries have no storage limitations for overview purposes


## Tips for Optimal Use  
1. Always start with the big picture (Library)  
2. Then zoom in on specific topics (Chat)  
3. Use Recurring Themes for larger sessions  
4. Export insights for further use

## Example Questions for Chat

**General tip**: When chatting , start with a general question. Then ask additional questions to get more specific information. If you want to know something specific right away, you can ask for that information right away.

#### Multiple discussions  

- **Question**: Take structured and nuanced notes of the selected discussions. If possible, include quotes where interesting.  
- **Question**: Write a report on the discussions. This is a summary of the structure of each discussion: [Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, ...]. If possible, include quotes where interesting.  
- **Question**: Were any specific action items/recommendations mentioned? If yes, mention these. If possible, include quotes where interesting.  
- **Question**: Give me a 3 paragraph summary of the selected discussions.  
- **Question**: Which topics/themes were discussed the most?

**EXTRA**: DURING A SESSION  
- **Question**: What issues have been discussed so far in the selected conversations?  
- **Question**: What are the differing opinions on?  
- **Question**: Is there a big difference noticeable between the different groups?



#### One discussion/consultation/meeting  

- **Question**: Take structured and nuanced notes of the selected conversation. If possible, include quotes where interesting.  
- **Question**: Write a report on the selected discussion. This is a summary of the structure of the consultation: [insert meeting structure. E.g. 1. Introduction 2. Improve Neighborhood Works 3. New Year's Drinks 4. Action items 5. Miscellaneous round]  
- **Question**: Give me a 3 paragraph summary of the selected consultation.  
- **Question**: What topics/themes were discussed the most?  
- **Question**: Were any specific action items/recommendations mentioned? If yes, please list these. If possible, include quotes where interesting.  
- **INZOOM**  
- **Question**: Can you give a more nuanced/exhaustive answer about ...?  
- **Question**: What specific aspects are mentioned about [topic/theme]? Add quotes where interesting.  
- **Question**: What is said about ...?  
- **Question**: What were the different views/opinions on ...?  
- **Question**: Are there any particular contradictions to note about [topic]?  
- **Question**: What topics would be interesting to discuss in more depth in a follow-up session?


#### Multiple consecutive meetings/consultations

**Question**: It has been a while since these consultations took place. What are the main points we discussed in the selected discussions? What action points were listed?  
**Question**: Given the selected conversations, what points should we definitely discuss at a follow-up meeting?


**General tip**: When chatting , start with a general question. Then ask additional questions to get more specific information. If you want to know something specific right away, you can ask for that information right away.

## echo/avoiding-pitfalls.en-US.mdx

# Avoiding common pitfalls
Common pitfals can be categorized into two groups: AI reliability and session facilitation. AI reliability is related to the transcription and LLM models, while session facilitation is related to the way the conversation is conducted.

Read more about [AI reliability](/echo/avoiding-pitfalls/technical) and [session facilitation](/echo/avoiding-pitfalls/social).\

## echo/avoiding-pitfalls/social.en-US.mdx

# Facilitation
Facilitation can significantly impact the quality and outcomes of your sessions. Here's a detailed breakdown of common social pitfalls and how to avoid them:

## Session Structure and Goals
- **Unclear Objectives**: Not having a clear goal for the session can lead to unfocused discussions and missed opportunities. Before each session, establish clear objectives and share them with participants.
- **Rigid Agendas**: While having a structure is important, sticking too rigidly to an agenda can prevent valuable insights from emerging. Allow for organic discussion while gently guiding the conversation back to key topics.

## Participant Engagement
- **Unbalanced Participation**: Letting dominant personalities control the conversation while quieter participants remain unheard. Use facilitation techniques to ensure everyone has a chance to contribute.
- **Premature Problem-Solving**: Not letting participants fully express their frustrations or concerns before jumping to solutions. Allow time for venting and emotional processing to ensure all perspectives are heard.
- **Leading Questions**: Directing participants toward predetermined conclusions rather than listening to their authentic experiences and ideas.

## Environment and Setup
- **Unsuitable Spaces**: Using environments that aren't conducive to open discussion (too noisy, uncomfortable, or lacking privacy). Choose appropriate spaces that make participants feel secure and comfortable.
- **Time Constraints**: Not allocating enough time for meaningful discussion or rushing through important topics. Plan realistic timeframes that allow for both structured discussion and natural conversation flow.

## Communication and Transparency
- **Unclear Expectations**: Not informing participants about:
  - The session's purpose and intended outcomes
  - How their input will be used
  - The presence and purpose of ECHO
  - Follow-up plans and next steps
- **Feedback Misalignment**: Seeking feedback on solutions that don't address the actual problems participants have discussed. Always ensure proposed solutions directly relate to the concerns raised in the session.

## Trust and Psychological Safety
- **Limited Psychological Safety**: Not creating an environment where participants feel safe sharing honest opinions and concerns. Build trust by:
  - Setting clear ground rules about confidentiality
  - Acknowledging and validating all contributions
  - Managing conflict constructively
  - Demonstrating active listening

## Follow-up and Implementation
- **Lack of Follow-through**: Not acting on or communicating about insights gained from the session. Always:
  - Document key takeaways and action items
  - Share summaries with participants
  - Provide updates on implementation progress
  - Schedule follow-up sessions when necessary

By being mindful of these social aspects and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, you can create more effective and meaningful sessions that generate valuable insights and maintain participant engagement.

# AI reliability
## Transcription errors and hallucinations
ECHO uses industry-leading transcription technology to transcribe your conversations. However, there is always a chance that the transcription is not 100% accurate. 

### Causes of transcription errors
- **Model Limitations**: ECHO may produce repeated words o`r phrases, especially in languages with less extensive training data.
- **Audio Quality**: Background noise, silences, or mixed sounds can confuse the model, leading to inaccuracies.
- **Language Detection**: Incorrect language settings can cause the model to transcribe in the wrong language, resulting in errors.

### Mitigation
- **Language Specification**: Explicitly set the correct language in the transcription settings to prevent misinterpretation. 
- **Audio Quality**: Try to record in a quiet environment, and make sure the recording device is not too far away from the speaker. In general, the closer the better.
- **Prompting**: Add the proper nouns and slang or jargon terms you expect to see in the conversation to provide additional context to the model under Portal Editor > Advanced Settings.

In general we find that both Chat and Library are able to filter out most errors, especially single word errors, for example when transcribing "Dembrane" as "Dembrain", ECHO wont get confused.

## Chat/Library Hallucinations
Both Chat and Library use industry leading LLM's to answer your questions, but they might not be able to answert all questions accurately.

### Causes of hallucinations
If you ask a question and the answer is not in the dataset, ECHO might try to answer but it might not be accurate. For example, you might organise a session where the goal was to come up with SMART goals, but it turns out that the participants mostly discussed the problems they face. In this case, ECHO will try to extrapolate SMART goals from the problems they discussed, which might not be accurate.

Asking leading questions like "Make a list of the ideas they discussed" may lead to hallucinations if participants didn't discuss any ideas. Asking for quotes can help, but with strongly leading questions and bad quality audio leading to bad transcriptions, ECHO might hallucinate the quotes.

### Mitigation
In general, asking more open questions like "What did participants discuss?" will help to avoid hallucinations as you give the LLM more room to give an answer that fits the **data**, rather than an answer that fits the **question**.
## echo/core-concepts.en-US.mdx

# Core Concepts

The core concepts of ECHO are:

- **Library** - The library is the place where you can create insights from ALL your conversations.
- **Views** - Views are perspectives with which to analyze all the conversations in a project.
- **Insights** - Insights are clusters of quotes that ECHO has created from all the conversations in a project.
- **Ask** - The ask interface is where you can chat with a selection of conversations.
- **Portal** - The portal is where participants can join the conversation.

## echo/core-concepts/ask.en-US.mdx

# Ask / Chat

ECHO comes with an enterprise-grade large language model (LLM) chatbot built in, so you dont need to worry about setting up your own or using an external LLM. LLMs are great for asking questions and getting quick answers about your data.

LLM's are great but they have their limitations, you should always use your own knowledge and expertise to validate the answers you get from ECHO. 

## Example Questions for Chat

**General tip**: When chatting with ECHO, start with a general question. Then ask additional questions to get more specific information. If you want to know something specific right away, you can ask for that information right away.

## echo/core-concepts/dashboard.en-US.mdx

# Dashboard

The dashboard is the main interface for analyzing your conversation data. It provides a wide range of tools and features to help you explore, analyze, and understand your data.

## Overview

The home page is the first page you see when you log in. It shows all your projects. Select a project to start analyzing. Create a new project by clicking the "Create" button. 

Dashboard settings can be found in the top right corner. This is whhere you can report an issue and change your dashboard language.

When you select a project, you will see the following sections:

- **Project Settings**: Change the name of your project and add any context that might help ECHO understand your project and its goals. This is also where you can export all of your transcripts and delete your project.
- **Portal Editor**: This is where you can create and edit the project's participant portal. Change the language, ask for a name or keep it anonymous, set the tutorial type, list of tags for the participants to select, and more.
- **Ask**: Click this to start chatting with ECHO. Your chat history will be saved in the "Chats" section.
- **Library**: Click this to navigate to the insights [library](library).
- **[#] Chats**: A collection of your chats with ECHO.
- **[#] Conversations**: A collection of conversations and their transcripts.

## echo/core-concepts/library.en-US.mdx

# Library

The library is the place where you can create insights from ALL your conversations. Using a proprietary democratic sampling algorithm, we ensure every voice is heard and no single voice is overrepresented. 

The library has 2 tools:
- **Views**: Create perspectives on which to analyze the conversations.
- **Insights**: Explore insight clusters that ECHO has created from the conversations.

To get started, generate the library by clicking the button in the dashboard. This will take a few minutes so do it once you have collected all your conversations.

Once the library is generated, you can use it to create views and explore the insights.

## Views
A view is a perspective on which to analyze the conversations. A view allways has a title and a description, and contains a set of aspects. Click on a view to see all its aspects. Click on an aspect to see the quotes that inspired it.

Reccuring themes and Sentiment are two default aspects that are created when you generate the library. You can also create your own views using the "Create View" button.

When you create a view, you are creating a perspective on which to analyze the conversations. Often, its hard to come up with good views that arent different versions of "recurring themes" or "sentiment". Some good examples are:

**View on Core Values**
Title: "Core Values"
Description: "What principles and beliefs drive people's choices and opinions?"

**View on Challenges & Frustrations**
Title: "Challenges & Frustrations"
Description: "What problems, obstacles, or difficulties do people consistently mention?"

**View on Unmet Needs**
Title: "Unmet Needs"
Extra context: "What are people looking for or wishing they had?"

**View on Signs of Progress**
Query: "Signs of Progress"
Extra context: "How do people define and measure success?"

**View on Key Influences**
Query: "Key Influences"
Extra context: "What people, events, or experiences shape their thinking?"

**View on Aims & Aspirations**
Query: "Aims & Aspirations"
Extra context: "What are people trying to achieve or work toward?"

**View on Points of Reference**
Query: "Points of Reference"
Extra context: "What do people compare their experiences to?"

**View on Tools & Support**
Query: "Tools & Support"
Extra context: "What resources do people rely on or wish they had?"

You can create as many views as you want, and they will all be saved in the library. 


## Insights
Insights are clusters of insights that ECHO has created from the conversations. They are created by analyzing the conversations and finding patterns and themes. Click on an insight to see the conversations that it reffers to and the quotes that inspired it.

## echo/core-concepts/portal.en-US.mdx

# Participant Portal
The participant portal is ECHO's main interface for participants. It is a web application that allows anyone to add their voice to the conversation.

## How to use the Participant Portal

1. Create a project in the [Dembrane Dashboard](https://dashboard.dembrane.com)
2. Scan the QR code or click the link to start the conversation.
3. Add your voice to the conversation
4. Share the link with others to have them join the conversation!

## Features
The participant portal has a few great features:
- Its voice first, so anyone can speak your mind without typing. Dont worry, it also has a text input for accessibility.
- It's set and forget, so you can focus on the conversation.
- You can use it anonymously, or ask for names.
- You can use it on any device, and it's accessible from any browser.
- You can ask for tags, so you can filter the data later.
- You can set many different languages and translate it automatically, so you can hear anyone!
- You can set the tutuorial level to tailor the experience for participants who have never used it before.
- You can add any content to the recording page, to make it more engaging or collect feedback on specific content.

> It's that simple!

# Your First Analysis

You have set-up your project and shared the invitation link to the portal with participants. Next, you can start analyse the conversations and extract insights as they are flowing into the Dashboard.


## What You'll Learn
- How to access and view conversation transcripts in your dashboard
- How to create and use Libraries to get AI-clustered overviews of participant conversations
- How to create custom Views to organize conversations around specific research questions
- How to use the Ask feature to explore your data through conversational AI queries


## Using the Dashboard for Analysis during or after a Session

### Step 1: Accessing Transcripts
1. First, navigate to your dashboard and open the project that you want to be working in
2. If you want to, you can view individual real-time conversation transcripts by clicking on the unique conversation

In general, there are two ways how Dembrane lets you explore your data

### Option 1: Creating a Library

 Libraries are a great way to get a broad overview, and a feeling for what participants were talking about, clustered around questions or topics of your choice!

1. In your dashboard, click the **"Library"** button in the sidebar. This will take you to your project library. 
2. Initially, your library will be empty as indicated by the blue status message on top of the page. Here you will also see how many conversations are waiting to be processed
3. Now click **"Create Library"** By default, the library will create two so called **"Views"** - Topics and Sentiment. Views are the topics, questions, themes of your choice which the AI will use as basis for clustering the conversation quotes
   
![](/img16.png)

4. Click "Create Library" and wait until the processing is complete. This can take a while
5. Once the library is generated you can start exploring the two default views - Topics and Sentiment - which should now have so called **"Aspects"** attached to them. Aspects are AI generated clusters surrounding the question or query of the view. Click into one of them to start exploring how conversation quotes were clustered around the aspect.
6. After creating your first library, you are ready to create your first unique views!

![](/img19.png)

**Note**: You might find in the library that some cluster-themes have 100’s of quotes, whereas others have few or even zero. Often the clusters that have many quotes are the ‘open doors’, clusters you can expect in advance to appear. The quotes with fewer quotes are the ones the AI identifies as relevant, and can be interesting avenues to explore with your participants.

#### Step 1: Creating Views

1. In your project library, click **"Create View"**
2. **Enter your query**: Here you can ask your research question.
3. **Additional context:** This is about what you want the AI to pay particular attention too, or for example how many clusters you want (Like a top 10 list)
4. If you click **"Create view"** the AI will start gathering relevant quotes.

![](/img20.png)

#### Step 2: Exploring Views

There are multiple ways to explore a view.  

1. By clicking on the expand icon in the top right corner of your view, you will see a more detailed overview of the view.
2. You can at any point, click into one of the aspects to start exploring how conversation quotes were clustered around the aspect.
3. For each quote you will see the conversation source attached. Clicking it will take you straight to the **"Analysis"** tab of the conversation, which lists not only all extracted quotes but also AI generated **Insights**.  

![](/img21.png)


**Note**: Once you have generated your first library, the **"Create Library"** button in the top right corner will now say **"Regenerate Library"**. This is especially relevant when after creating your initial library, you have more conversations which are being recorded. These will not automatically be added to the library which is why you will need to regenerate.

### Option 2: Using the Ask Feature

If you want to have a more conversational way to explore your data click the **"Ask"** button in the sidebar of your dashboard. This will take you to an AI chat interface. Here you can ask specific questions to dig deeper and chat with your data. E.g. “What are the arguments that are presented when discussing X”,  or, “What seem to be the biggest differences in values between recording X and recording Y”?

1. Importantly, if you are currently viewing a conversation in the dashboard and click **"Ask"**, it will automatically select the conversation as context for the chat, making a blue tick-mark appear. Simply deselect if this was not your intention.
2. If you click "Ask" without currently viewing a conversation, it will take you to the chat interface without any specific context added.
3. You can always add context to your chat by checking the boxes next to the individual conversation.

**Note**: The system is designed to help you make sense of complex conversation data efficiently. The Library is your starting point, while the Chat helps you dive deeper into specific areas of interest.

Now you are well equipped to create a project, share it with your participants and start collecting data.

# Collecting Your First Data

Learn how to effectively collect and manage conversation data using Dembrane. 

## What You'll Learn
- How to access and share your ECHO portal via QR code or direct link
- Best practices for testing your first recording
- Setting up a conversation project in minutes
- Viewing and managing transcripts in the dashboard
- Getting started with participant invitations


## Step 1: Accessing the Portal

In general, there are two ways to access and share the portal:

### Option 1: Scan QR Code
For each of your projects, there is a QR code automatically created for you and displayed at the top of your Project page. The bar also displays the number of ongoing conversations and gives you the option to open or close the portal for participation.

![](/img7.png)

To scan the QR code, simply open your phone camera and point it at the code. A URL to a website should pop up automatically. This link will take you to the participant portal.

### Option 2: Direct Links
Alternatively, you can directly copy the link to the portal and share it via email or messaging.

## Step 2: Testing the Portal 

1. Before sharing the portal with participants, it is best to try it out yourself! For this create your first project and scan the portal QR code or access it using the link. 
2. Go step-by-step through the required tutorial
3. Start recording a short three minute conversation - if you have trouble finding a topic, try talking to the portal about this Japanese koan:

> "A citizen asks ECHO: 'How can I speak when no one listens?' ECHO replies: 'Who heard you ask that question?'"

Finish the recording and wait until the transcripts are uploaded. Now navigate back to your dashboard and open the conversation you just recorded in the project sidebar.

![](/img11.png)

By clicking on the conversation you will be taken to the Conversation overview. Here you can see when the conversation was created, change the name or assign a new tag. 

![](/img10.png)

If you wish to delete this entire conversation, click <span className="text-red-500">Delete Conversation</span>

Check whether you can see your transcript in the **"Transcript"** tab. If this is the case, you are good to go and share your project with participants!

## Step 3: Sharing the Portal with Participants

Once your test is complete you can start sharing your project with participants. As outlined above, simply share the QR code or invite URL via your preferred channels such as E-Mail, WhatsApp etc.
