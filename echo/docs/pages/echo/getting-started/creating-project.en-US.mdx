### Project Settings

Now you will be taken to your main dashboard view. First, make sure you are in the **"Project Settings"** tab. Here you will need to set-up a few things:

#### Edit Project

1. **Name**: Give your project a name instead of **"New Project"**. Choose something descriptive and recognisable. You can change this later if needed
2. **Context**: Add details about your project's purpose (internal use). This could for example be what the goal of the project is
