## Step 1: Accessing the Portal

In general, there are two ways to access and share the portal:

### Option 1: Scan QR Code
For each of your projects, there is a QR code automatically created for you and displayed at the top of your Project page. The bar also displays the number of ongoing conversations and gives you the option to open or close the portal for participation.

To scan the QR code, simply open your phone camera and point it at the code. A URL to a website should pop up automatically. This link will take you to the participant portal.

### Option 2: Direct Links
Alternatively, you can directly copy the link to the portal and share it via email or messaging.

## Step 2: Testing the Portal 

1. Before sharing the portal with participants, it is best to try it out yourself! For this create your first project and scan the portal QR code or access it using the link. 
2. Go step-by-step through the required tutorial
3. Start recording a short three minute conversation - if you have trouble finding a topic, try talking to the portal about this Japanese koan:

> "A citizen asks ECHO: 'How can I speak when no one listens?' ECHO replies: 'Who heard you ask that question?'"

Finish the recording and wait until the transcripts are uploaded. Now navigate back to your dashboard and open the conversation you just recorded in the project sidebar.

By clicking on the conversation you will be taken to the Conversation overview. Here you can see when the conversation was created, change the name or assign a new tag.

If you wish to delete this entire conversation, click <span className="text-red-500">Delete Conversation</span>

Check whether you can see your transcript in the **"Transcript"** tab. If this is the case, you are good to go and share your project with participants!

## Step 3: Sharing the Portal with Participants

Once your test is complete you can start sharing your project with participants. As outlined above, simply share the QR code or invite URL via your preferred channels such as E-Mail, WhatsApp etc.
