# Analysis Overview
In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to optimally use the dashboard. We'll cover several key areas to help you efficiently navigate through large amounts of conversation data.

## What You'll Learn
- Effective chat strategies for detailed analysis
- Managing large datasets with the Library
- Intermediate Prompt Engineering
- Uploading your own audio files

## Analysis Workflow Overview
1. Start with the Library to identify broad themes across the entire dataset
2. Segment the dataset into smaller groups using tags.
3. Use Chat for detailed analysis of the smaller groups (less than 10 hours of conversation)
4. <span style={{'color': 'grey'}}>Export insights as needed _(coming soon)_</span>

## Technical Limitations
- Maximum recommended conversations in chat: ~10 hours total
- They library has no size limitations, but it will take longer to create and generate new views if you have a large dataset.
