# Welcome!  
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optimally use the dashboard and chat function. We'll follow a step-by-step approach that helps you efficiently navigate through large amounts of conversation data.

## Step 1: Start with the Library  
Before diving into chat, it's crucial to get a good overview:  

1. Open the Library function  
2. Formulate a clear main question (views)  
3. Let the system identify the key themes  
4. Explore the different clusters that emerge

**Tip:** Think of the Library as your "map" of all available information. It helps you understand where to find specific information.

## Step 2: Explore the Themes  
In the Library, you can:  

- Click on interesting clusters  
- Read brief summaries  
- View relevant quotes  
- Click on the quotes to go to full transcripts

**Why this works:** You quickly gain insight into the main themes without getting lost in details.

## Step 3: Targeted Chat Questions  
Now that you know what information is available:  

- Select relevant conversations (max. ~10 hours of material)  
- Ask specific questions about the themes you've identified  
- Use the chat for in-depth analysis

**Important:** The chat has limited capacity. Therefore, be selective about which conversations you want to analyse.


## Working with Large Datasets  
When dealing with extensive conversation data:  

1. Use the Library to identify key themes  
2. Select the most relevant conversations for chat analysis  
3. Break down your research into manageable segments  
4. Use exports to compile comprehensive reports

## Technical Notes  
- Chat buffer: approximately 10% per hour of conversation  
- Maximum recommended conversations in chat: ~10 hours total  
- Libraries have no storage limitations for overview purposes


## Tips for Optimal Use  
1. Always start with the big picture (Library)  
2. Then zoom in on specific topics (Chat)  
3. Use Recurring Themes for larger sessions  
4. Export insights for further use
