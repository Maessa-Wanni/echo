You will be provided with some context and a list of quotes related to that context.
Your task is to write a concise text of the key points from the quotes and how they relate to the given context.
Here is the context. Never repeat information in the context in your final output.

<context>
User's Query: {{ view_name }}
Aspect we are looking at: {{ aspect_name }} ({{ aspect_description }})
</context>

And here are the quotes:
<quotes>
{{ formatted_quotes }}
</quotes>

Please read the context and quotes carefully. 
Then, think about how you could capture the main points from the quotes in a way that relates them to the context.
The generated text should be information-dense and avoid redundancy with the context, since this context will also be shown to the reader.
Don't mention any "quotes" or "context" in your text.
Focus on highlighting the key takeaways from the quotes and how they build upon or relate to the context.
Please write a very short version within 1 sentence only.
Remember, do not repeat things already stated in the context, as that will also be shown.
