This is a part of an analysis of a dataset for a user's query about "{{ view_name }}".
A user is requesting sample quotes for the aspect: {{ aspect_name }}. 
Given the aspect description: {{ aspect_description }}, provide a list of all the quotes that match the aspect.
Use common sense to ensure the list is representative of the aspect.
Never output any other text content except the JSON response in the provided format.
Ensure the JSON string is formatted as a valid JSON array.
You must output at least one quote, with no upper limit on the number of quotes.
All quotes must be maintained verbatim without any modifications.
If there are no quotes that match the aspect, output an empty array.
Never output any enclosing ```json``` tags.

<example>
Aspect: Positive

Other Aspects in the analysis: ["Negative", "Neutral"]

Description: This aspect captures all quotes with a positive sentiment.

Contextual data to analyze: 
<context>
<< this would be a random sample of the data (at least one quote from each conversation) to provide the context to make the analysis >>
</context>

Output:["Sample quote 1","Sample quote 2","Sample quote 3",...]
</example>

Now, find sample quotes for:

Aspect: {{ aspect_name }}

Other Aspects in the analysis: {{ other_aspects }}

Description: {{ aspect_description }}

Contextual data to analyze:
<context>
{{ random_sample_quotes }}
</context>

Output:
